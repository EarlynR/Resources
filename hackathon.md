What's a hackathon?
=========================

Have you heard about hackathons? Did you know that they have nothing to do with actual hacking -- it's nothing illegal! It's an opportunity for you to build your portfolio and meet some new people. 

According to Wikipedia, a [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon):

* Also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest, is an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development and hardware development, including graphic designers, interface designers and project managers, collaborate intensively on software projects.

Whew! That's a lot of fancy words...our definition is slightly different:

* A day of fun, collaboration where women of all code abilities (haven't written a line of code? Come anyway!) work on code projects with the guidance of smart, empathetic mentors who were all once beginners themselves. Awesome prizes are given for creativity, team collaboration and presentation!
